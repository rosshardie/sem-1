**Scope:**

Regardless of whether it is within public or project spaces our Code of Conduct will still apply when an individual is representing the community/project. Examples of this could be posting on an official project social media account, an official project email address or any online and offline project events. The definition of representation can be further clarified by the project maintainers if it is felt necessary. 

**Enforcement:**

Any instances of this code of conduct being broken should be reported to the project team (40338719@live.napier.ac.uk) where all complaints will be investigated and assessed. We will respond as soon as possible, and this will result in a punishment which is felt necessary depending on the specific circumstances. The reporter will remain anonymous and the incident will be confidential. These rules also apply to project maintainers who do not follow the code of conduct as well, any breech of conduct may result in repercussion that are determined by other members of the projects leadership.
